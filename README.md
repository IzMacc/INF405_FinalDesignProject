    This repository will be the main source for our design project for a mobile app teaching about AI

The goal of this project is to teach students about AI so they can understand its 
background, use cases, and ethical considerations. The project will be developed in a way that 
anyone can understand the concepts peresented in educational simulations described without prior knowledge of AI. This means not 
only students, but anyone else who desires to learn about AI can. The scope of development of an interactive, story-based AI 
literacy app. The product will exist and fit into the educational technology environment and will 
support users seeking knowledge in AI and its ethical concerns and decision-making. The 
adjacent systems that need to be understood in this project include the users, the app content 
creators, the software platforms, the user device, and their operating systems.
